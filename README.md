About
=====

This is a GitHub app written using Flask for the Astropy project which can be
installed via GitHub integrations. The main functionality at the moment is to check
that a changelog entry is present and that some key maintenance labels (e.g.
affects-dev) and milestones are set and consistent with the changelog.

This requires Python 3.6 to run.
